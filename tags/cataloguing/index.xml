I’m writing this down because I often spend a lot of time reading through exiftool documentation to find out how to get something done, just to forget it within hours.

I’d also outline my workflow as I present each software in the order in which it appears in the workflow. Just to set the context, I use Microsoft Windows 7 for my imaging tasks, and my camera is a Nikon D90, so I do use a lot of Nikon software.</description></item></channel></rss>
