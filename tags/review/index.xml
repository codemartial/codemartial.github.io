As per Wikipedia, it’s the world’s largest air show after the one in Paris. I first came to know of it when a friend of mine armed with a Nikon D70s and a non-VR 70-300 f/4-5.6 came back with some fabulous shots way back in 2007. Ten years later, I got to visit the show with a Nikon D7100 and an AF-P DX 70-300mm f/4.</description></item><item><title>AF-S Nikkor 20mm ƒ/1.8G on DX</title><link>https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/16/nikkor-20mm-on-dx/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2016 21:34:15 +0000</pubDate><author>mail@tahirhashmi.com (Tahir Hashmi)</author><guid>https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/16/nikkor-20mm-on-dx/</guid><description>Early this year, I acquired a used 20mm ƒ/1.8G Nikkor lens. I only have DX bodies and the 20mm works more like a wide-normal prime than an ultra-wide, as on FX.
20mm ƒ/1.8G Nikkor on a D7100. It’s big. Why use 20mm ƒ/1.8G? on DX? I had long wanted to have a small, fast 24mm prime for my DX bodies. While the 35mm ƒ/1.8 DX is compact enough, I don’t like it that much.</description></item><item><title>Six Months with Nikon D7100</title><link>https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/six-months-with-nikon-d7100/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2013 20:48:04 +0000</pubDate><author>mail@tahirhashmi.com (Tahir Hashmi)</author><guid>https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/six-months-with-nikon-d7100/</guid><description>It’s been more than six months since I have had a Nikon D7100 for my own and I have been thinking of writing down my thoughts about the camera. However, these six months with the camera have been a bit of an up-and-down journey and it’s only now that I feel like I know the camera enough to write about it.
The D7100 is an enthusiasts’ camera and it will make you earn that title before you can be get along with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
