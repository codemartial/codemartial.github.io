On the front-end Iâ€™ve done some JavaScript and Iâ€™ve also had the misfortune of programming in Java ðŸ˜‰
I started programming in Go in 2012 and since then I havenâ€™t wanted to program in any other language. Iâ€™ve had a handful of large Go implementations across two companies and by now I have my own short list of favourite features.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2018/06/01/best-feature-of-go/>Continue reading â†’</a></p><h2>Inheritance Semantics in Go</h2><p>Contemporary application design discipline is deeply rooted in Object Oriented Analysis and Design and inheritance is a key concept in OOAD. Go does not support classes and inheritance in their classic OOP sense but since many of us are trained in OOP, the loss of an important design concept sometimes feels restrictive.
Even though I knew about embedding and interfaces, their connection with classic inheritance wasnâ€™t quite obvious. I set out to understand how I could emulate the coarse inheritance semantics in Go, without going into fine nuances.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/01/22/inheritance-semantics-in-go/>Continue reading â†’</a></p><h2>The Compiler as a Refactoring Aid</h2><p>Recently, I sat down to refactor a Go application with a high-level design objective in place. The application had two conceptually separate entities implemented in different files but mashed into a single package. I needed to separate them out into their own packages. I wasnâ€™t using an IDE â€” just Emacs with basic formatting and non-contextual auto-complete aids.
I started out by creating a new directory for the package to be split out and moved the files that contained most of the relevant code into that directory, without thinking of the consequences.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/23/the-compiler-as-a-refactoring-aid/>Continue reading â†’</a></p><h2>Go Workshop</h2><p>Last week, I conducted a 2 day Go Workshop at my workplace. It was fun.
I started day 1 with the excellent Go at Google presentation by Rob Pike, followed by my own presentation of Goâ€™s key features. The rest of Day 1 was spent taking the Go Tour.
The coolest thing I did was on day 2. I mirrored my laptop on the projector and went through a fresh install of Go from source on my [newly allocated] dev box.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/21/go-workshop/>Continue reading â†’</a></p><h2>Why I Program in Go</h2><p>Go is a fresh new programming language, that has come out of Google and is primarily targeted towards server development. It is developed by some very accomplished computer scientists, like Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. I recently launched a significant new productÂ built with Go at work, and it has proved itself out very well in terms of developer productivity and performance. So much so that many other teams are also giving it a go (oh, how punny this languageâ€™s name is).</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/05/why-program-in-go/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><div id=sidebar><nav class=sidebar-nav><ul><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/posts/ title=Articles>Articles</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/about/ title=About>About</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/photos/ title=Photos>Photos</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/opinion/ title=opinion>opinion</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/photography/ title=photography>photography</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/programming/ title=programming>programming</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/reviews/ title=reviews>reviews</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/technology/ title=technology>technology</a></li></ul><div id=fastSearch><span id=cursor><input id=searchInput tabindex=0 placeholder=search></span><ul id=searchResults></ul></div></nav></div><div id=section2><p>Golang</p></div><div id=logo><a href=/><svg id="svgLogo" baseProfile="full" xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 400 100" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid"><radialGradient id="logoGradient"><stop offset="30%" stop-color="#00ff80"/><stop offset="67%" stop-color="#00c000"/><stop offset="100%" stop-color="#606000"/></radialGradient><polygon points="0, 67 160, 0 200, 100 240, 0 400, 67 240, 33 200, 67 160, 33" fill="url(#logoGradient)"/></svg></a></div><div id=space><p>Tahir Hashmi</p></div><footer id=footer>mail@tahirhashmi.com
