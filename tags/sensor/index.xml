If you had to guess the sensor size, considering that this is a minimally edited photo, what would be your guess? FX? DX? m43? 1″? 1/1.7″? 1/2.3″?
Small sensor systems are all the rage these days. 24-1200mm zoom in a handy little package. How about that? The problem is, tiny sensors come with compromises.</description></item><item><title>Sensor Format Blind Test Results</title><link>https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/11/08/sensor-format-blind-test-results/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2013 11:57:06 +0000</pubDate><author>mail@tahirhashmi.com (Tahir Hashmi)</author><guid>https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/11/08/sensor-format-blind-test-results/</guid><description>The results of the Sensor Format Blind Test are out!
I got a total of 13 responses, which is a bit too low for a full-blown, conclusive ranking analysis. We can, however, do some meaningful analysis if we ask simpler questions. To start with,
“Is the photo from Format X the best?”
To answer this question, we simply count the number of respondents who placed the photo from the given format as the best.</description></item><item><title>Sensor Format Blind Test</title><link>https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/31/sensor-format-blind-test/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2013 11:41:11 +0000</pubDate><author>mail@tahirhashmi.com (Tahir Hashmi)</author><guid>https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/31/sensor-format-blind-test/</guid><description>TL;DR Rank the four shots below from best to worst.
