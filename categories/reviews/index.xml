However, my Nikon D750 feels a bit like an overkill for this job, as does my Nikon D500&amp;hellip; or Z6 or even Z50.
What I want for this occasion is something svelte. Like a Nikon Coolpix A or a Nikon J5. Except the former is as usable as a butter knife for carving steak and the latter is often outdone by an iPhone.</description></item></channel></rss>
