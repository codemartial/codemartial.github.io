      <description>One of the biggest differentiators between an effective technology team and an ineffective one is not the average technology skill level of its members, but the maturity of the team’s software development methodology. In other words, a team of less skilled developers with better methodology would outperform a team of more skilled developers with poor methodology. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if you could succeed with competent talent instead of battling for the elusive “rockstars” in the talent market?</description>
