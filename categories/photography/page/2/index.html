I have been shooting photographs regularly for over 7 years now. I spent the first year shooting with a 2 Megapixel phone camera. Since then, however, I’ve almost always had RAW capable cameras and shot RAW compulsively. And why not? I get 16x or 64x more colour depth than JPEGs. I don’t have to bother about setting the right white balance, contrast or sharpness. I don’t have to choose between monochrome and colour at the time of shooting.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/05/11/shooting-jpegs/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Nikon D90 vs. Sony RX100 in Goa</h2><p>Last weekend I was in Goa on a leisure trip, which gave me an excellent opportunity for some photography. I carried the RX100 for landscape and street photography. The D90 also came along mainly for long range shooting with the 55-300mm VR and low light shooting with the 50mm f/1.8D. This trip allowed me to sort out some things related to the pros and cons of using a big DSLR vs.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/03/08/d90-vs-rx100-in-goa/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Nikon 1 J1 Review</h2><p>My gear has evolved from P&S to DSLRs over the last five years, and each year I end up buying a new camera. The focus this year, was on reducing the size and weight of the camera gear, unlike previous years where I had been looking to acquire the latest sensor technology (although I was tempted to swap my D3100 with D3200!).
What started out as a quest for cheap backup P&S, ended up as a story about Nikon 1.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/02/25/nikon1-j1-review/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Impact of Sensor Size on Performance — a Contemporary Survey</h2><p>I am in the middle of a choice between interchangeable lens systems and one of my pressing needs is the selection of a system that lets me have a smaller, lighter camera bag. Now is not a bad time to be shopping for cameras, with so much choice being available across price brackets and IQ variance. As always, having a lot to choose from is another way of getting confused, so I decided to do some objective data analysis to figure out what’s what.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/02/09/sensor-size-vs-performance/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>State of the Camera 2012: Part 2</h2><p>In Part 1 of this two-part series we looked at some of the dominant technology trends over the last couple of years and the impact they are having on cameras and photography. In this part of the series, I write about my impressions of a few recent cameras that I have had the opportunity to use.
Sony CyberShot DSC-RX100 Voted by Time Magazine as one of the best inventions of 2012 and declared to be the best pocket camera ever made by New York Times reviewer David Pogue, this camera has changed the way people respond to small sensor sizes.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/05/cameras-2012-2/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>State of the Camera 2012: Part 1</h2><p>It’s been exactly two years since I last wrote about a camera on this blog. A lot has changed in the camera scene over the last two years and I fell in and out of love with the NEX-5 during this time as well. In this post I shall begin with talking about the recent trends in the camera market followed by short reviews of a few new generation cameras that I have tried or bought.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2012/12/26/cameras-2012-1/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>NEX-5 Early Impressions</h2><p>It’s been a week since I’ve had my baby camera, i.e. the Sony α NEX-5 and I’ve been enjoying it so far. Here’s a quick low down of the ups and downs I’ve encountered with the camera.
The Good Outstanding IQ in any shooting conditions that can only be trumped by careful, deliberate shooting with a DSLR equipped with high quality optics Small enough to fit in my laptop bag, if not the jeans pocket Excellent iAuto mode for quick snapshots Fairly easy to use controls, esp.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/12/26/nex-5-short-review/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>My Imaging Tools and Workflow</h2><p>As my photos get backed up and burnt on to a DVD, I thought I might just do a quick cataloguing of the software I’ve found useful for developing my photographs and what each does. I’d also outline my workflow as I present each software in the order in which it appears in the workflow. Just to set the context, I use Microsoft Windows 7 for my imaging tasks, and my camera is a Nikon D90, so I do use a lot of Nikon software.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/11/01/software-toolkit-workflow/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Which Compact Interchangeable-Lens Camera?</h2><p>These are exciting times for DSLR enthusiasts. We’ve all marvelled at the creative and operational flexibility afforded by the large dial, switch and button infested DSLR bodies and interchangeable purpose-built lenses. We’ve been spoiled for the impeccable image quality afforded by the 8.5-15x larger APS-C sensors (upto 34x larger if you’re a 35mm shooter). It’s impossible to look back at compacts. Or is it?
Most DSLR shooters sooner or later realise that their beloved hunk can’t be their only camera.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/09/22/which-compact-camera/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Creating Hand-held HDRs</h2><p>On my recent vacation, I took a bunch of bracketed exposures to turn into HDRs. Before this trip I only used a tripod for bracketing. This time around, however, I had to deal with hand-held bracketed shots. To make things a bit worse, these shots included foliage, which isn’t always stationary between shots. Picturenaut utterly failed to align these images. I tried Luminance HDR (qtpfsgui) for Windows 7 (64-bit), and it simply kept crashing.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/09/21/handheld-hdrs/>Continue reading →</a></p><section id=pagination><a href=/categories/photography/>&lt;&lt;</a>
