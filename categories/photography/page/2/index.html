I got a total of 13 responses, which is a bit too low for a full-blown, conclusive ranking analysis. We can, however, do some meaningful analysis if we ask simpler questions. To start with,
“Is the photo from Format X the best?”
To answer this question, we simply count the number of respondents who placed the photo from the given format as the best.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/11/08/sensor-format-blind-test-results/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Sensor Format Blind Test</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/31/sensor-format-blind-test/>October 31, 2013</a></p>TL;DR Rank the four shots below from best to worst.

However, these six months with the camera have been a bit of an up-and-down journey and it’s only now that I feel like I know the camera enough to write about it.
The D7100 is an enthusiasts’ camera and it will make you earn that title before you can be get along with it.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/six-months-with-nikon-d7100/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>From Shooting RAWs to Shooting JPEGs</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/05/11/shooting-jpegs/>May 10, 2013</a></p>To Shoot RAW or JPEG? I have been shooting photographs regularly for over 7 years now. I spent the first year shooting with a 2 Megapixel phone camera. Since then, however, I’ve almost always had RAW capable cameras and shot RAW compulsively. And why not? I get 16x or 64x more colour depth than JPEGs. I don’t have to bother about setting the right white balance, contrast or sharpness. I don’t have to choose between monochrome and colour at the time of shooting.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/05/11/shooting-jpegs/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Nikon D90 vs. Sony RX100 in Goa</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/03/08/d90-vs-rx100-in-goa/>March 8, 2013</a></p>Last weekend I was in Goa on a leisure trip, which gave me an excellent opportunity for some photography. I carried the RX100 for landscape and street photography. The D90 also came along mainly for long range shooting with the 55-300mm VR and low light shooting with the 50mm f/1.8D. This trip allowed me to sort out some things related to the pros and cons of using a big DSLR vs.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/03/08/d90-vs-rx100-in-goa/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Nikon 1 J1 Review</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/02/25/nikon1-j1-review/>February 25, 2013</a></p>My gear has evolved from P&amp;S to DSLRs over the last five years, and each year I end up buying a new camera. The focus this year, was on reducing the size and weight of the camera gear, unlike previous years where I had been looking to acquire the latest sensor technology (although I was tempted to swap my D3100 with D3200!).
What started out as a quest for cheap backup P&amp;S, ended up as a story about Nikon 1.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/02/25/nikon1-j1-review/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Impact of Sensor Size on Performance — a Contemporary Survey</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/02/09/sensor-size-vs-performance/>February 9, 2013</a></p>I am in the middle of a choice between interchangeable lens systems and one of my pressing needs is the selection of a system that lets me have a smaller, lighter camera bag. Now is not a bad time to be shopping for cameras, with so much choice being available across price brackets and IQ variance. As always, having a lot to choose from is another way of getting confused, so I decided to do some objective data analysis to figure out what’s what.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/02/09/sensor-size-vs-performance/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>State of the Camera 2012: Part 2</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/05/cameras-2012-2/>January 4, 2013</a></p>In Part 1 of this two-part series we looked at some of the dominant technology trends over the last couple of years and the impact they are having on cameras and photography. In this part of the series, I write about my impressions of a few recent cameras that I have had the opportunity to use.

A lot has changed in the camera scene over the last two years and I fell in and out of love with the NEX-5 during this time as well. In this post I shall begin with talking about the recent trends in the camera market followed by short reviews of a few new generation cameras that I have tried or bought.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2012/12/26/cameras-2012-1/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>NEX-5 Early Impressions</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/12/26/nex-5-short-review/>December 26, 2010</a></p>It’s been a week since I’ve had my baby camera, i.e. the Sony α NEX-5 and I’ve been enjoying it so far. Here’s a quick low down of the ups and downs I’ve encountered with the camera.
