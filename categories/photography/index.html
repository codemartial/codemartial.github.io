This, on the surface, looks like poor value proposition. After all, even the cheapest kit lens is going to have a 28mm equivalent focal length at its wide end. So a review of this lens needs to start with addressing why someone would even consider paying for this lens.
Unique Qualities of 28mm Optically, a 28mm1 lens provides a wide field of view, which roughly matches what we see or percieve of our environment.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/nikkor-28mm-f1_4e-review/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Quest for the Best Focal Length</h2><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/best-focal-length/ title="Quest for the Best Focal Length" style=background-color:transparent><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/2324/1515012386_2d919d6567_b.jpg alt="Representative image for the topic, Quest for the Best Focal Length" align=left width=50% style=margin-right:1em;aspect-ratio:1.499267935578331></a><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/best-focal-length/>March 23, 2023</a></p>If I were to be left with only one focal length to take photos with for the rest of my life, which would I pick? This is my journey through 15+ years to find the answer to that question. Why it&rsquo;s taken me this long to arrive the answer has a lot to do with experimentation, self-discovery and some great technological advancements. It all starts with the wrong type of 50mm.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/best-focal-length/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Fujifilm X100V Review: An Unfulfilled Dream</h2><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/x100v-review/ title="Fujifilm X100V Review: An Unfulfilled Dream" style=background-color:transparent><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52759788756_60bff3bcab_c.jpg alt="Representative image for the topic, Fujifilm X100V Review: An Unfulfilled Dream" align=left width=50% style=margin-right:1em;aspect-ratio:1.5037593984962405></a><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/x100v-review/>March 20, 2023</a></p>A few months ago, I reviewed the Fujifilm X-E4 and mentioned that I got that camera because
For years, I&rsquo;ve been searching for something that&rsquo;s compact, elegant and competent &ndash; a &ldquo;Vanity Camera&rdquo;, as I call it. After much deliberation, I settled on getting the world&rsquo;s prettiest camera, a Fujifilm x100v. Except, as of this writing, I couldn&rsquo;t find a new body in three different countries that I looked.
Well, it turned out that my brother managed to find an X100V and was gracious enough to swap it for my X-E4 kit.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/x100v-review/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Fujifilm X-E4: An Engaging Experience I'd Rather Not Have</h2><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/fujifilm-x-e4/ title="Fujifilm X-E4" style=background-color:transparent><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52326059948_7d65c6bbc2.jpg alt="Representative image for the topic, Fujifilm X-E4" align=left width=50% style=margin-right:1em;aspect-ratio:1.4984984984984986></a><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/fujifilm-x-e4/>September 1, 2022</a></p>When I&rsquo;m on a business trip and I go for breakfast at the hotel&rsquo;s restaurant, I want to take a few photos of the ambience and the food. However, my Nikon D750 feels a bit like an overkill for this job, as does my Nikon D500&mldr; or Z6 or even Z50.
What I want for this occasion is something svelte. Like a Nikon Coolpix A or a Nikon J5. Except the former is as usable as a butter knife for carving steak and the latter is often outdone by an iPhone.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/fujifilm-x-e4/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>exiftool Examples</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2021/05/06/exiftool-examples/>May 6, 2021</a></p>Following is a collection of real exiftool commands that I’ve used, along with explanations of what each does. exiftool is a command-line utility that provides very powerful EXIF reading, writing and searching capabilities.
I’m writing this down because I often spend a lot of time reading through exiftool documentation to find out how to get something done, just to forget it within hours. All of these examples work on a Unix shell environment like ZSH on MacOS or the various Linux shells.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2021/05/06/exiftool-examples/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>D7100 and AF-P DX 70-300 VR on an Airshow</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2017/03/13/d7100-af-p-70-300-vr-airshow/>March 13, 2017</a></p>Aero India is a biennial air show that takes place on an airfield on the outskirts of Bangalore. As per Wikipedia, it’s the world’s largest air show after the one in Paris. I first came to know of it when a friend of mine armed with a Nikon D70s and a non-VR 70-300 f/4-5.6 came back with some fabulous shots way back in 2007. Ten years later, I got to visit the show with a Nikon D7100 and an AF-P DX 70-300mm f/4.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2017/03/13/d7100-af-p-70-300-vr-airshow/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Factoring the Crop</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/21/factoring-the-crop/>August 21, 2016</a></p>Here’s a picture whose EXIF I have stripped so you won’t know what equipment was used to shoot it.
If you had to guess the sensor size, considering that this is a minimally edited photo, what would be your guess? FX? DX? m43? 1″? 1/1.7″? 1/2.3″?
Small sensor systems are all the rage these days. 24-1200mm zoom in a handy little package. How about that? The problem is, tiny sensors come with compromises.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/21/factoring-the-crop/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>AF-S Nikkor 20mm ƒ/1.8G on DX</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/16/nikkor-20mm-on-dx/>August 16, 2016</a></p>Early this year, I acquired a used 20mm ƒ/1.8G Nikkor lens. I only have DX bodies and the 20mm works more like a wide-normal prime than an ultra-wide, as on FX.
20mm ƒ/1.8G Nikkor on a D7100. It’s big. Why use 20mm ƒ/1.8G? on DX? I had long wanted to have a small, fast 24mm prime for my DX bodies. While the 35mm ƒ/1.8 DX is compact enough, I don’t like it that much.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/16/nikkor-20mm-on-dx/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Nikon D750 + 20mm f/1.8G Nikkor</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2015/03/24/nikon-d750-20mm-f1-8g-nikkor-tryout/>March 24, 2015</a></p>A few days ago I got the opportunity to try out a Nikon D750, along with the new 20mm f/1.8G Nikkor lens. It wasn’t the best of times for trying out new toys for me, because of which I couldn’t get any presentable shots. I still got some shooting to do with it and I would go ahead to include those non-presentable shots anyway.

The default carrying solution – neck strap – has a couple of disadvantages:
It’s extremely tiring for the neck muscles It’s very fiddly, and gets in the way too much Most of you might already have faced problem #1.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/12/22/carrying-cameras/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><section id=pagination><label>Page 1 of 3</label>
