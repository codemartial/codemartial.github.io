However, my Nikon D750 feels a bit like an overkill for this job, as does my Nikon D500&mldr; or Z6 or even Z50.
What I want for this occasion is something svelte. Like a Nikon Coolpix A or a Nikon J5. Except the former is as usable as a butter knife for carving steak and the latter is often outdone by an iPhone.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/fujifilm-x-e4/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>exiftool Examples</h2><p>Following is a collection of real exiftool commands that I’ve used, along with explanations of what each does. exiftool is a command-line utility that provides very powerful EXIF reading, writing and searching capabilities.
I’m writing this down because I often spend a lot of time reading through exiftool documentation to find out how to get something done, just to forget it within hours. All of these examples work on a Unix shell environment like ZSH on MacOS or the various Linux shells.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2021/05/06/exiftool-examples/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>D7100 and AF-P DX 70-300 VR on an Airshow</h2><p>Aero India is a biennial air show that takes place on an airfield on the outskirts of Bangalore. As per Wikipedia, it’s the world’s largest air show after the one in Paris. I first came to know of it when a friend of mine armed with a Nikon D70s and a non-VR 70-300 f/4-5.6 came back with some fabulous shots way back in 2007. Ten years later, I got to visit the show with a Nikon D7100 and an AF-P DX 70-300mm f/4.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2017/03/13/d7100-af-p-70-300-vr-airshow/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Factoring the Crop</h2><p>Here’s a picture whose EXIF I have stripped so you won’t know what equipment was used to shoot it.
If you had to guess the sensor size, considering that this is a minimally edited photo, what would be your guess? FX? DX? m43? 1″? 1/1.7″? 1/2.3″?
Small sensor systems are all the rage these days. 24-1200mm zoom in a handy little package. How about that? The problem is, tiny sensors come with compromises.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/21/factoring-the-crop/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>AF-S Nikkor 20mm ƒ/1.8G on DX</h2><p>Early this year, I acquired a used 20mm ƒ/1.8G Nikkor lens. I only have DX bodies and the 20mm works more like a wide-normal prime than an ultra-wide, as on FX.
20mm ƒ/1.8G Nikkor on a D7100. It’s big. Why use 20mm ƒ/1.8G? on DX? I had long wanted to have a small, fast 24mm prime for my DX bodies. While the 35mm ƒ/1.8 DX is compact enough, I don’t like it that much.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/16/nikkor-20mm-on-dx/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Nikon D750 + 20mm f/1.8G Nikkor</h2><p>A few days ago I got the opportunity to try out a Nikon D750, along with the new 20mm f/1.8G Nikkor lens. It wasn’t the best of times for trying out new toys for me, because of which I couldn’t get any presentable shots. I still got some shooting to do with it and I would go ahead to include those non-presentable shots anyway. Nikon D750 with 20mm f/1.8G Nikkor AF-S 20mm f/1.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2015/03/24/nikon-d750-20mm-f1-8g-nikkor-tryout/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Carrying Cameras</h2><p>The Problem One of the big issues I face while photographing outdoors is that of having to carry a big 1.5 kg camera, and usually additional lenses and accessories weighing another 1-2 kg, all the time while out shooting for the day. The default carrying solution – neck strap – has a couple of disadvantages:
It’s extremely tiring for the neck muscles It’s very fiddly, and gets in the way too much Most of you might already have faced problem #1.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/12/22/carrying-cameras/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Sensor Format Blind Test Results</h2><p>The results of the Sensor Format Blind Test are out!
I got a total of 13 responses, which is a bit too low for a full-blown, conclusive ranking analysis. We can, however, do some meaningful analysis if we ask simpler questions. To start with,
“Is the photo from Format X the best?”
To answer this question, we simply count the number of respondents who placed the photo from the given format as the best.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/11/08/sensor-format-blind-test-results/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Sensor Format Blind Test</h2><p>TL;DR Rank the four shots below from best to worst. Mention the position as top-right, bottom-left, etc. Submit your ranking as a comment. Rank the above images from best to worst. Mention positions as top-right, bottom-left, etc. The Fuss These are interesting times for camera enthusiasts. Digital cameras have advanced to a level where most cameras are capable of publication quality snaps and you don’t even need to carry a camera to take good pictures, thanks to smartphones.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/31/sensor-format-blind-test/>Continue reading →</a></p><h2>Six Months with Nikon D7100</h2><p>It’s been more than six months since I have had a Nikon D7100 for my own and I have been thinking of writing down my thoughts about the camera. However, these six months with the camera have been a bit of an up-and-down journey and it’s only now that I feel like I know the camera enough to write about it.
The D7100 is an enthusiasts’ camera and it will make you earn that title before you can be get along with it.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/six-months-with-nikon-d7100/>Continue reading →</a></p><section id=pagination><label>Page 1 of 3</label>
