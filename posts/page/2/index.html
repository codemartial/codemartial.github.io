The default carrying solution – neck strap – has a couple of disadvantages:
It’s extremely tiring for the neck muscles It’s very fiddly, and gets in the way too much Most of you might already have faced problem #1.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/12/22/carrying-cameras/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Farewell, Photography</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/05/20/farewell-photography/>May 19, 2014</a></p>Update: I couldn’t stay away for long. That, and I conquered the sharpness gremlins plaguing my experience with the heavily used AF-S DX 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6G VR.

Go does not support classes and inheritance in their classic OOP sense but since many of us are trained in OOP, the loss of an important design concept sometimes feels restrictive.
Even though I knew about embedding and interfaces, their connection with classic inheritance wasn’t quite obvious. I set out to understand how I could emulate the coarse inheritance semantics in Go, without going into fine nuances.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/01/22/inheritance-semantics-in-go/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Sensor Format Blind Test Results</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/11/08/sensor-format-blind-test-results/>November 8, 2013</a></p>The results of the Sensor Format Blind Test are out!
I got a total of 13 responses, which is a bit too low for a full-blown, conclusive ranking analysis. We can, however, do some meaningful analysis if we ask simpler questions. To start with,
“Is the photo from Format X the best?”
To answer this question, we simply count the number of respondents who placed the photo from the given format as the best.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/11/08/sensor-format-blind-test-results/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Sensor Format Blind Test</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/31/sensor-format-blind-test/>October 31, 2013</a></p>TL;DR Rank the four shots below from best to worst.

Here’s what I think about it. There are a few things that are very different about designing HTTP APIs as compared to language-native implementation design:
The goal of an HTTP API is to minimise coupling and facilitate interoperability, which is less of a concern when the usage environment is restricted to a single programming language and its runtime</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/mapping-oo-interfaces-to-rest/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Six Months with Nikon D7100</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/six-months-with-nikon-d7100/>October 27, 2013</a></p>It’s been more than six months since I have had a Nikon D7100 for my own and I have been thinking of writing down my thoughts about the camera. However, these six months with the camera have been a bit of an up-and-down journey and it’s only now that I feel like I know the camera enough to write about it.
The D7100 is an enthusiasts’ camera and it will make you earn that title before you can be get along with it.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/six-months-with-nikon-d7100/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>The Lost Flickr of Hope</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/07/04/the-lost-flickr-of-hope/>July 4, 2013</a></p>I woke up this Tuesday morning to a shock.

This bar is wrong in a lot of ways. The way it stands out in all its ugliness from the rest of the Flickr visual design speaks volumes about how it was executed (thoughtlessly, in a draconian way), how little the Flickr development team have a say in how things work (I can’t imagine a product owner who would allow such visual desecration of their product without a protest) and how little Yahoo!</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/07/04/the-lost-flickr-of-hope/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>From Shooting RAWs to Shooting JPEGs</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/05/11/shooting-jpegs/>May 10, 2013</a></p>To Shoot RAW or JPEG? I have been shooting photographs regularly for over 7 years now. I spent the first year shooting with a 2 Megapixel phone camera. Since then, however, I’ve almost always had RAW capable cameras and shot RAW compulsively. And why not? I get 16x or 64x more colour depth than JPEGs. I don’t have to bother about setting the right white balance, contrast or sharpness. I don’t have to choose between monochrome and colour at the time of shooting.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/05/11/shooting-jpegs/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Nikon D90 vs. Sony RX100 in Goa</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/03/08/d90-vs-rx100-in-goa/>March 8, 2013</a></p>Last weekend I was in Goa on a leisure trip, which gave me an excellent opportunity for some photography. I carried the RX100 for landscape and street photography. The D90 also came along mainly for long range shooting with the 55-300mm VR and low light shooting with the 50mm f/1.8D.
