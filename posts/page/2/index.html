If you had to guess the sensor size, considering that this is a minimally edited photo, what would be your guess? FX? DX? m43? 1″? 1/1.7″? 1/2.3″?
Small sensor systems are all the rage these days. 24-1200mm zoom in a handy little package. How about that? The problem is, tiny sensors come with compromises.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/21/factoring-the-crop/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>AF-S Nikkor 20mm ƒ/1.8G on DX</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/16/nikkor-20mm-on-dx/>August 16, 2016</a></p>Early this year, I acquired a used 20mm ƒ/1.8G Nikkor lens. I only have DX bodies and the 20mm works more like a wide-normal prime than an ultra-wide, as on FX.
20mm ƒ/1.8G Nikkor on a D7100. It’s big. Why use 20mm ƒ/1.8G? on DX? I had long wanted to have a small, fast 24mm prime for my DX bodies. While the 35mm ƒ/1.8 DX is compact enough, I don’t like it that much.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/16/nikkor-20mm-on-dx/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Nikon D750 + 20mm f/1.8G Nikkor</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2015/03/24/nikon-d750-20mm-f1-8g-nikkor-tryout/>March 24, 2015</a></p>A few days ago I got the opportunity to try out a Nikon D750, along with the new 20mm f/1.8G Nikkor lens. It wasn’t the best of times for trying out new toys for me, because of which I couldn’t get any presentable shots. I still got some shooting to do with it and I would go ahead to include those non-presentable shots anyway.

The default carrying solution – neck strap – has a couple of disadvantages:
It’s extremely tiring for the neck muscles It’s very fiddly, and gets in the way too much Most of you might already have faced problem #1.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/12/22/carrying-cameras/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Farewell, Photography</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/05/20/farewell-photography/>May 19, 2014</a></p>Update: I couldn’t stay away for long. That, and I conquered the sharpness gremlins plaguing my experience with the heavily used AF-S DX 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6G VR.
We had a good thing going for eight years or so, but it’s time now to bring it to a halt.
Back when I started, I had no dearth of time to give to myself and I had no one but myself to spend money on.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/05/20/farewell-photography/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Inheritance Semantics in Go</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/01/22/inheritance-semantics-in-go/>January 22, 2014</a></p>Contemporary application design discipline is deeply rooted in Object Oriented Analysis and Design and inheritance is a key concept in OOAD. Go does not support classes and inheritance in their classic OOP sense but since many of us are trained in OOP, the loss of an important design concept sometimes feels restrictive.
Even though I knew about embedding and interfaces, their connection with classic inheritance wasn’t quite obvious. I set out to understand how I could emulate the coarse inheritance semantics in Go, without going into fine nuances.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2014/01/22/inheritance-semantics-in-go/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Sensor Format Blind Test Results</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/11/08/sensor-format-blind-test-results/>November 8, 2013</a></p>The results of the Sensor Format Blind Test are out!
I got a total of 13 responses, which is a bit too low for a full-blown, conclusive ranking analysis. We can, however, do some meaningful analysis if we ask simpler questions. To start with,
“Is the photo from Format X the best?”
To answer this question, we simply count the number of respondents who placed the photo from the given format as the best.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/11/08/sensor-format-blind-test-results/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Sensor Format Blind Test</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/31/sensor-format-blind-test/>October 31, 2013</a></p>TL;DR Rank the four shots below from best to worst.

Mention positions as top-right, bottom-left, etc. The Fuss These are interesting times for camera enthusiasts. Digital cameras have advanced to a level where most cameras are capable of publication quality snaps and you don’t even need to carry a camera to take good pictures, thanks to smartphones.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/31/sensor-format-blind-test/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Mapping OO Interfaces to REST</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/mapping-oo-interfaces-to-rest/>October 28, 2013</a></p>A few days ago, my BBF (Big Boss Forever) Vijay R asked the following question:
Any resources on how to map OO design (controlled state change via methods) to RESTful services? #help

Here’s what I think about it. There are a few things that are very different about designing HTTP APIs as compared to language-native implementation design:
The goal of an HTTP API is to minimise coupling and facilitate interoperability, which is less of a concern when the usage environment is restricted to a single programming language and its runtime</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/mapping-oo-interfaces-to-rest/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Six Months with Nikon D7100</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/six-months-with-nikon-d7100/>October 27, 2013</a></p>It’s been more than six months since I have had a Nikon D7100 for my own and I have been thinking of writing down my thoughts about the camera. However, these six months with the camera have been a bit of an up-and-down journey and it’s only now that I feel like I know the camera enough to write about it.
The D7100 is an enthusiasts’ camera and it will make you earn that title before you can be get along with it.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/six-months-with-nikon-d7100/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><section id=pagination><a href=/posts/>&lt;&lt;</a>
