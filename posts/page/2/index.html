It was fun.
I started day 1 with the excellent Go at Google presentation by Rob Pike, followed by my own presentation of Go‚Äôs key features. The rest of Day 1 was spent taking the Go Tour.
The coolest thing I did was on day 2. I mirrored my laptop on the projector and went through a fresh install of Go from source on my [newly allocated] dev box.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/21/go-workshop/>Continue reading ‚Üí</a></p><h2>Why I Program in Go</h2>Go is a fresh new programming language, that has come out of Google and is primarily targeted towards server development. It is developed by some very accomplished computer scientists, like Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. I recently launched a significant new product¬†built with Go at work, and it has proved itself out very well in terms of developer productivity and performance. So much so that many other teams are also giving it a go (oh, how punny this language‚Äôs name is).</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/05/why-program-in-go/>Continue reading ‚Üí</a></p><h2>Find and Edit File</h2>While working on a huge code-base with several thousand source files, it becomes difficult to remember where each file is. If you use conventions like one file per class, you can at least figure out the file name. E.g. the definition of class Foo would be found in Foo.class.xx or something like that.
Thankfully, ack makes it easy to find the location files in a project. Just say, ack -g Foo.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2011/11/24/find-and-edit-file/>Continue reading ‚Üí</a></p><h2>Need a new Start-up Idea? Mash up Social and Cloud</h2>Are you based out of India and need an idea for a technology start-up? Try thinking of two of the biggest technology buzzwords of the day and mash ‚Äôem up together. Social + Cloud!
Back in the ol‚Äô days when system programming and desktop applications were hot, people were trying to create applications that could run on more than one OS. There was a sprouting of libraries, proprietary and open source, that promised abstraction from the operating system internals.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2011/09/19/new-start-up-idea/>Continue reading ‚Üí</a></p><h2>Beating the TripAdvisor Badge‚Äôs SEO Tactic</h2>The Problem Recently, I got a reference to this article from my Product Manager, regarding TripAdvisor badges and how they boost SEO. Their secret is a simple link that links deep into TripAdvisor website and makes your site a donor of link love to TripAdvisor. This is somewhat bad for hotel owners who might find that TripAdvisor trumps the search ranking for their brand name.
The easy solution to prevent that from happening would be to slightly edit TA widget and use a rel="nofollow" attribute in the anchor that links to TripAdvisor.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/08/24/beating-tripadvisor-seo/>Continue reading ‚Üí</a></p><h2>Simple PHP Timer</h2>I was just trying to profile an HTML page for performance bottle-necks. I‚Äôm trying to follow a top-down approach, wherein I start from the entry script, and find the block of code that takes the biggest chunk of time before digging deeper into that chunk.
At this stage, it‚Äôs not feasible to drop in a full-blown profiling tool like xdebug because of the set-up overhead and amount of data it generates.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/08/09/simple-php-timer/>Continue reading ‚Üí</a></p><h2>PHP vs. Python for Web Apps</h2>These days, more and more people ask the Python vs. PHP question when they start out with a web application from scratch. I‚Äôve developed PHP applications for 5 years but for the last couple of years I‚Äôve been doing Python. This post is meant to note some of my observations. If you don‚Äôt want to read the whole of it, my opinion ‚Äî¬†opinion ‚Äî is to stick with PHP for dishing out your *ML.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/07/28/php-vs-python-for-web-apps/>Continue reading ‚Üí</a></p><h2>MySQLdb Leaks Memory</h2>Whenever people search for a Python library for MySQL, they get directed to MySQL for Python. However, there are some nasties hidden in it. Searching for ‚Äúmysql python memory leaks‚Äù results in a few links which suggest that using Unicode causes memory leaks with the library.
Today, however, I found another cause for MySQLdb memory leaks, while debugging a leaky Python daemon at work ‚Äî¬†database errors.
