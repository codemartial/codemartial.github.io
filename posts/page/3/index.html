The focus this year, was on reducing the size and weight of the camera gear, unlike previous years where I had been looking to acquire the latest sensor technology (although I was tempted to swap my D3100 with D3200!).
What started out as a quest for cheap backup P&S, ended up as a story about Nikon 1.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/02/25/nikon1-j1-review/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Impact of Sensor Size on Performance — a Contemporary Survey</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/02/09/sensor-size-vs-performance/>February 9, 2013</a></p>I am in the middle of a choice between interchangeable lens systems and one of my pressing needs is the selection of a system that lets me have a smaller, lighter camera bag. Now is not a bad time to be shopping for cameras, with so much choice being available across price brackets and IQ variance. As always, having a lot to choose from is another way of getting confused, so I decided to do some objective data analysis to figure out what’s what.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/02/09/sensor-size-vs-performance/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>The Compiler as a Refactoring Aid</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/23/the-compiler-as-a-refactoring-aid/>January 23, 2013</a></p>Recently, I sat down to refactor a Go application with a high-level design objective in place. The application had two conceptually separate entities implemented in different files but mashed into a single package. I needed to separate them out into their own packages. I wasn’t using an IDE — just Emacs with basic formatting and non-contextual auto-complete aids.
I started out by creating a new directory for the package to be split out and moved the files that contained most of the relevant code into that directory, without thinking of the consequences.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/23/the-compiler-as-a-refactoring-aid/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Go Workshop</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/21/go-workshop/>January 21, 2013</a></p>Last week, I conducted a 2 day Go Workshop at my workplace. It was fun.
I started day 1 with the excellent Go at Google presentation by Rob Pike, followed by my own presentation of Go’s key features. The rest of Day 1 was spent taking the Go Tour.
The coolest thing I did was on day 2. I mirrored my laptop on the projector and went through a fresh install of Go from source on my [newly allocated] dev box.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/21/go-workshop/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Why I Program in Go</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/05/why-program-in-go/>January 5, 2013</a></p>Go is a fresh new programming language, that has come out of Google and is primarily targeted towards server development. It is developed by some very accomplished computer scientists, like Ken Thompson and Rob Pike. I recently launched a significant new product built with Go at work, and it has proved itself out very well in terms of developer productivity and performance. So much so that many other teams are also giving it a go (oh, how punny this language’s name is).</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/05/why-program-in-go/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>State of the Camera 2012: Part 2</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/05/cameras-2012-2/>January 4, 2013</a></p>In Part 1 of this two-part series we looked at some of the dominant technology trends over the last couple of years and the impact they are having on cameras and photography. In this part of the series, I write about my impressions of a few recent cameras that I have had the opportunity to use.
Sony CyberShot DSC-RX100 Voted by Time Magazine as one of the best inventions of 2012 and declared to be the best pocket camera ever made by New York Times reviewer David Pogue, this camera has changed the way people respond to small sensor sizes.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/05/cameras-2012-2/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>State of the Camera 2012: Part 1</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2012/12/26/cameras-2012-1/>December 25, 2012</a></p>It’s been exactly two years since I last wrote about a camera on this blog. A lot has changed in the camera scene over the last two years and I fell in and out of love with the NEX-5 during this time as well. In this post I shall begin with talking about the recent trends in the camera market followed by short reviews of a few new generation cameras that I have tried or bought.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2012/12/26/cameras-2012-1/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>High on Lo-Fi</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2012/02/15/high-on-lo-fi/>February 15, 2012</a></p>The camera industry is going through some pretty big movements these days. Since the advent of digital cameras and social networking websites, more and more people have been finding interest in taking photos and exhibiting them online to friends and public at large. Somewhere in this explosive growth of photography, veterans and early enthusiasts sometimes find themselves in a tight spot.
Big Camera, Small Camera Since their inception, digital camera sensors have been pushing the boundaries of the quality of images they produce.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2012/02/15/high-on-lo-fi/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Find and Edit File</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2011/11/24/find-and-edit-file/>November 24, 2011</a></p>While working on a huge code-base with several thousand source files, it becomes difficult to remember where each file is. If you use conventions like one file per class, you can at least figure out the file name. E.g. the definition of class Foo would be found in Foo.class.xx or something like that.
Thankfully, ack makes it easy to find the location files in a project. Just say, ack -g Foo.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2011/11/24/find-and-edit-file/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Need a new Start-up Idea? Mash up Social and Cloud</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2011/09/19/new-start-up-idea/>September 19, 2011</a></p>Are you based out of India and need an idea for a technology start-up? Try thinking of two of the biggest technology buzzwords of the day and mash ’em up together. Social + Cloud!
Back in the ol’ days when system programming and desktop applications were hot, people were trying to create applications that could run on more than one OS. There was a sprouting of libraries, proprietary and open source, that promised abstraction from the operating system internals.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2011/09/19/new-start-up-idea/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><section id=pagination><a href=/posts/page/2/>&lt;&lt;</a>
