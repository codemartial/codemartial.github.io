Mash up Social and Cloud</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2011/09/19/new-start-up-idea/>September 19, 2011</a></p>Are you based out of India and need an idea for a technology start-up? Try thinking of two of the biggest technology buzzwords of the day and mash ’em up together. Social + Cloud!
Back in the ol’ days when system programming and desktop applications were hot, people were trying to create applications that could run on more than one OS. There was a sprouting of libraries, proprietary and open source, that promised abstraction from the operating system internals.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2011/09/19/new-start-up-idea/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>NEX-5 Early Impressions</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/12/26/nex-5-short-review/>December 26, 2010</a></p>It’s been a week since I’ve had my baby camera, i.e. the Sony α NEX-5 and I’ve been enjoying it so far. Here’s a quick low down of the ups and downs I’ve encountered with the camera.
The Good Outstanding IQ in any shooting conditions that can only be trumped by careful, deliberate shooting with a DSLR equipped with high quality optics Small enough to fit in my laptop bag, if not the jeans pocket Excellent iAuto mode for quick snapshots Fairly easy to use controls, esp.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/12/26/nex-5-short-review/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>My Imaging Tools and Workflow</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/11/01/software-toolkit-workflow/>November 1, 2010</a></p>As my photos get backed up and burnt on to a DVD, I thought I might just do a quick cataloguing of the software I’ve found useful for developing my photographs and what each does. I’d also outline my workflow as I present each software in the order in which it appears in the workflow. Just to set the context, I use Microsoft Windows 7 for my imaging tasks, and my camera is a Nikon D90, so I do use a lot of Nikon software.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/11/01/software-toolkit-workflow/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Which Compact Interchangeable-Lens Camera?</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/09/22/which-compact-camera/>September 22, 2010</a></p>These are exciting times for DSLR enthusiasts. We’ve all marvelled at the creative and operational flexibility afforded by the large dial, switch and button infested DSLR bodies and interchangeable purpose-built lenses. We’ve been spoiled for the impeccable image quality afforded by the 8.5-15x larger APS-C sensors (upto 34x larger if you’re a 35mm shooter). It’s impossible to look back at compacts. Or is it?
Most DSLR shooters sooner or later realise that their beloved hunk can’t be their only camera.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/09/22/which-compact-camera/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Creating Hand-held HDRs</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/09/21/handheld-hdrs/>September 21, 2010</a></p>On my recent vacation, I took a bunch of bracketed exposures to turn into HDRs. Before this trip I only used a tripod for bracketing. This time around, however, I had to deal with hand-held bracketed shots. To make things a bit worse, these shots included foliage, which isn’t always stationary between shots. Picturenaut utterly failed to align these images. I tried Luminance HDR (qtpfsgui) for Windows 7 (64-bit), and it simply kept crashing.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/09/21/handheld-hdrs/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Beating the TripAdvisor Badge’s SEO Tactic</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/08/24/beating-tripadvisor-seo/>August 24, 2010</a></p>The Problem Recently, I got a reference to this article from my Product Manager, regarding TripAdvisor badges and how they boost SEO. Their secret is a simple link that links deep into TripAdvisor website and makes your site a donor of link love to TripAdvisor. This is somewhat bad for hotel owners who might find that TripAdvisor trumps the search ranking for their brand name.
The easy solution to prevent that from happening would be to slightly edit TA widget and use a rel="nofollow" attribute in the anchor that links to TripAdvisor.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/08/24/beating-tripadvisor-seo/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Capturing Rain</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/08/18/capturing-rain/>August 18, 2010</a></p>With the monsoons doing their usual thing and I having the luxury of a not-too-bad view of the rains, I had been itching to capture a shot of the rain in all its glory. Earlier this year I made a capture that brought out the rainy-ness in the scene but didn’t have any rain as such.
Online research about shooting the rains didn’t bring much enlightenment because there’s no “formula” for making rain shots.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/08/18/capturing-rain/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Simple PHP Timer</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/08/09/simple-php-timer/>August 9, 2010</a></p>I was just trying to profile an HTML page for performance bottle-necks. I’m trying to follow a top-down approach, wherein I start from the entry script, and find the block of code that takes the biggest chunk of time before digging deeper into that chunk.
At this stage, it’s not feasible to drop in a full-blown profiling tool like xdebug because of the set-up overhead and amount of data it generates.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/08/09/simple-php-timer/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Shooting in the Dark</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/08/03/shooting-in-the-dark/>August 3, 2010</a></p>Digital sensors have made a lot of progress on the light efficiency front. The Nikon D3s sensor, currently the most efficient sensor available, offers amazingly clean images at crazy high ISOs. Something that film shooters could only dream of. There is still some time, however, before a D3s calibre sensor makes it to consumer bodies. Meanwhile, it will help knowing the tips and tricks of shooting in the dark for the win.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/08/03/shooting-in-the-dark/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Take Two</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/07/31/hello-world-2/>July 31, 2010</a></p>This isn’t my first time writing a photography blog. I started one, almost 3 years ago and wrote a few posts regarding technique and gear. It was probably too early to start writing, though, and the blog fell off the edge when my hosting plan expired and I didn’t renew it. This time, it will hopefully stay.
Photography is, for me, a new way to experience things. It’s about delving deep into the visual characteristics of the environment around me — shapes, contours, colours, location, the light that I’m seeing by.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2010/07/31/hello-world-2/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><section id=pagination><a href=/posts/page/3/>&lt;&lt;</a>
