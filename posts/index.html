Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I like wrangling with code to make interesting stuff happen. The problem is that for a long time now, making interesting stuff happen with code hasn&rsquo;t been the end game. Since the last ten years or so, it&rsquo;s become incredibly more complex to get finished code to start working in the real world (aka production). Some say it&rsquo;s because we <a href=https://twitter.com/jasoncwarner/status/1592227285024636928 target=_blank>OD&rsquo;d on microservices</a>. That probably true but there&rsquo;s more to it than that alone.</p></p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2022-11-27-metacomputer-why/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Fujifilm X-E4: An Engaging Experience I'd Rather Not Have</h2><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/fujifilm-x-e4/ title="Fujifilm X-E4" style=background-color:transparent><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52326059948_7d65c6bbc2.jpg alt="Representative image for the topic, Fujifilm X-E4" align=left width=50% style=margin-right:1em;aspect-ratio:1.4984984984984986></a><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/fujifilm-x-e4/>September 1, 2022</a></p>When I&rsquo;m on a business trip and I go for breakfast at the hotel&rsquo;s restaurant, I want to take a few photos of the ambience and the food. However, my Nikon D750 feels a bit like an overkill for this job, as does my Nikon D500&mldr; or Z6 or even Z50.
What I want for this occasion is something svelte. Like a Nikon Coolpix A or a Nikon J5. Except the former is as usable as a butter knife for carving steak and the latter is often outdone by an iPhone.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/fujifilm-x-e4/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>exiftool Examples</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2021/05/06/exiftool-examples/>May 6, 2021</a></p>Following is a collection of real exiftool commands that Iâ€™ve used, along with explanations of what each does. exiftool is a command-line utility that provides very powerful EXIF reading, writing and searching capabilities.
Iâ€™m writing this down because I often spend a lot of time reading through exiftool documentation to find out how to get something done, just to forget it within hours. All of these examples work on a Unix shell environment like ZSH on MacOS or the various Linux shells.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2021/05/06/exiftool-examples/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Using a QLC SSD for Backups.

However, Iâ€™m now using a Samsung 870 QVO for Time Machine backups on my Mac, despite its bottom-of-the-pile TBW (durability) rating. It actually makes sense.
The Backstory I have a 2017 iMac (bought that year as well) which I use as my primary home computer for photo/video editing, a bit of programming and a lot of Netflix and HBO Go as well.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2020/09/10/using-a-qlc-ssd-for-backups-makes-sense/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Buy or Build?</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2020/04/18/buy-or-build/>April 18, 2020</a></p>One of the decisions a CTO has to frequently make is whether to build some piece of functionality in-house or buy it from a third party vendor. In this post, I share my framework for making these decisions.
I also include a case study each for a buy decision and a build decision. Added bonus â€“ some thoughts on whether you should sell something youâ€™ve decided to build.
Functional Complexity One of the most important determinants of buy-vs-build decisions will be the ability to spec out the entire functionality.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2020/04/18/buy-or-build/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>5 Competitive Advantages in Technology</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2019/01/19/5-competitive-advantages-in-technology/>January 19, 2019</a></p>The technology universe is in a constant state of flux with new advancements arriving faster than one could keep up. A technology leader, in this scenario, needs to look for something durable to build the foundation of their new (or improved) technology organisation.
Spending 36 months leading the charge (and occasionally failing) at a fast growing business thatâ€™s powered by technology can teach a lot. Coming off the back of a career built with customer-facing development teams at companies serving over 100 million customers, I now have some idea of what it takes to make a strong technology foundation for a modern business.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2019/01/19/5-competitive-advantages-in-technology/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>The Best Feature of Go</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2018/06/01/best-feature-of-go/>June 1, 2018</a></p>Iâ€™ve been programming since the late 90â€™s and Iâ€™ve done quite a bit of coding in C, C++, a lot of it in PHP and some in Python as well. On the front-end Iâ€™ve done some JavaScript and Iâ€™ve also had the misfortune of programming in Java ðŸ˜‰
I started programming in Go in 2012 and since then I havenâ€™t wanted to program in any other language. Iâ€™ve had a handful of large Go implementations across two companies and by now I have my own short list of favourite features.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2018/06/01/best-feature-of-go/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>D7100 and AF-P DX 70-300 VR on an Airshow</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2017/03/13/d7100-af-p-70-300-vr-airshow/>March 13, 2017</a></p>Aero India is a biennial air show that takes place on an airfield on the outskirts of Bangalore. As per Wikipedia, itâ€™s the worldâ€™s largest air show after the one in Paris. I first came to know of it when a friend of mine armed with a Nikon D70s and a non-VR 70-300 f/4-5.6 came back with some fabulous shots way back in 2007. Ten years later, I got to visit the show with a Nikon D7100 and an AF-P DX 70-300mm f/4.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2017/03/13/d7100-af-p-70-300-vr-airshow/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Factoring the Crop</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/21/factoring-the-crop/>August 21, 2016</a></p>Hereâ€™s a picture whose EXIF I have stripped so you wonâ€™t know what equipment was used to shoot it.
If you had to guess the sensor size, considering that this is a minimally edited photo, what would be your guess? FX? DX? m43? 1â€³? 1/1.7â€³? 1/2.3â€³?
Small sensor systems are all the rage these days. 24-1200mm zoom in a handy little package. How about that? The problem is, tiny sensors come with compromises.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/21/factoring-the-crop/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>AF-S Nikkor 20mm Æ’/1.8G on DX</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/16/nikkor-20mm-on-dx/>August 16, 2016</a></p>Early this year, I acquired a used 20mm Æ’/1.8G Nikkor lens. I only have DX bodies and the 20mm works more like a wide-normal prime than an ultra-wide, as on FX.
20mm Æ’/1.8G Nikkor on a D7100. Itâ€™s big. Why use 20mm Æ’/1.8G? on DX? I had long wanted to have a small, fast 24mm prime for my DX bodies. While the 35mm Æ’/1.8 DX is compact enough, I donâ€™t like it that much.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2016/08/16/nikkor-20mm-on-dx/>Continue reading â†’</a></p></div><section id=pagination><label>Page 1 of 5</label>
