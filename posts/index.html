This, on the surface, looks like poor value proposition. After all, even the cheapest kit lens is going to have a 28mm equivalent focal length at its wide end. So a review of this lens needs to start with addressing why someone would even consider paying for this lens.
Unique Qualities of 28mm Optically, a 28mm1 lens provides a wide field of view, which roughly matches what we see or percieve of our environment.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/nikkor-28mm-f1_4e-review/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Quest for the Best Focal Length</h2><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/best-focal-length/ title="Quest for the Best Focal Length" style=background-color:transparent><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/2324/1515012386_2d919d6567_b.jpg alt="Representative image for the topic, Quest for the Best Focal Length" align=left width=50% style=margin-right:1em;aspect-ratio:1.499267935578331></a><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/best-focal-length/>March 23, 2023</a></p>If I were to be left with only one focal length to take photos with for the rest of my life, which would I pick? This is my journey through 15+ years to find the answer to that question. Why it&rsquo;s taken me this long to arrive the answer has a lot to do with experimentation, self-discovery and some great technological advancements. It all starts with the wrong type of 50mm.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/best-focal-length/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Fujifilm X100V Review: An Unfulfilled Dream</h2><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/x100v-review/ title="Fujifilm X100V Review: An Unfulfilled Dream" style=background-color:transparent><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52759788756_60bff3bcab_c.jpg alt="Representative image for the topic, Fujifilm X100V Review: An Unfulfilled Dream" align=left width=50% style=margin-right:1em;aspect-ratio:1.5037593984962405></a><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/x100v-review/>March 20, 2023</a></p>A few months ago, I reviewed the Fujifilm X-E4 and mentioned that I got that camera because
For years, I&rsquo;ve been searching for something that&rsquo;s compact, elegant and competent &ndash; a &ldquo;Vanity Camera&rdquo;, as I call it. After much deliberation, I settled on getting the world&rsquo;s prettiest camera, a Fujifilm x100v. Except, as of this writing, I couldn&rsquo;t find a new body in three different countries that I looked.
Well, it turned out that my brother managed to find an X100V and was gracious enough to swap it for my X-E4 kit.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/x100v-review/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>The MetaComputer™ (Part "What" of 3)</h2><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2022-12-09-metacomputer-what/ title='The MetaComputer™ (Part "What" of 3)' style=background-color:transparent><img src=/MetaComputerIcon.png alt='Representative image for the topic, The MetaComputer™ (Part "What" of 3)' align=left width=50% style=margin-right:1em;aspect-ratio:1></a><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2022-12-09-metacomputer-what/>December 9, 2022</a></p><p>In <a href=/posts/2022-11-27-metacomputer-why>part &ldquo;Why&rdquo;</a> of this series that appeared previously, I talked about the need for a new computing model that simplifies modern cloud-native distributed application development.

Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I like wrangling with code to make interesting stuff happen. The problem is that for a long time now, making interesting stuff happen with code hasn&rsquo;t been the end game. Since the last ten years or so, it&rsquo;s become incredibly more complex to get finished code to start working in the real world (aka production). Some say it&rsquo;s because we <a href=https://twitter.com/jasoncwarner/status/1592227285024636928 target=_blank rel=noopener>OD&rsquo;d on microservices</a>.

However, my Nikon D750 feels a bit like an overkill for this job, as does my Nikon D500&mldr; or Z6 or even Z50.
What I want for this occasion is something svelte. Like a Nikon Coolpix A or a Nikon J5. Except the former is as usable as a butter knife for carving steak and the latter is often outdone by an iPhone.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/fujifilm-x-e4/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>exiftool Examples</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2021/05/06/exiftool-examples/>May 6, 2021</a></p>Following is a collection of real exiftool commands that I’ve used, along with explanations of what each does. exiftool is a command-line utility that provides very powerful EXIF reading, writing and searching capabilities.
I’m writing this down because I often spend a lot of time reading through exiftool documentation to find out how to get something done, just to forget it within hours. All of these examples work on a Unix shell environment like ZSH on MacOS or the various Linux shells.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2021/05/06/exiftool-examples/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>Using a QLC SSD for Backups.

In this post, I share my framework for making these decisions.
I also include a case study each for a buy decision and a build decision. Added bonus – some thoughts on whether you should sell something you’ve decided to build.
Functional Complexity One of the most important determinants of buy-vs-build decisions will be the ability to spec out the entire functionality.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2020/04/18/buy-or-build/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><div class=section-entry><h2>5 Competitive Advantages in Technology</h2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2019/01/19/5-competitive-advantages-in-technology/>January 19, 2019</a></p>The technology universe is in a constant state of flux with new advancements arriving faster than one could keep up. A technology leader, in this scenario, needs to look for something durable to build the foundation of their new (or improved) technology organisation.
Spending 36 months leading the charge (and occasionally failing) at a fast growing business that’s powered by technology can teach a lot. Coming off the back of a career built with customer-facing development teams at companies serving over 100 million customers, I now have some idea of what it takes to make a strong technology foundation for a modern business.</p><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2019/01/19/5-competitive-advantages-in-technology/>Continue reading →</a></p></div><section id=pagination><label>Page 1 of 5</label>
