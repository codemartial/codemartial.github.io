While the 35mm ƒ/1.8 DX is compact enough, I don’t like it that much. The FoV (51mm FX equivalent) is too narrow for general photography and too wide for portraits. I do most of my portrait work with a 50mm ƒ/1.8G, so I need something to cover the wider end.</p><p>The 20mm is not a bad option. Its 30mm FX equivalent FoV actually matches that of some <a href=https://www.flickr.com/cameras/apple/iphone_6s/ target=_blank>very popular smartphones</a>, which is what I intended this lens for – having a smartphone camera equivalent with much superior image quality.</p><h2 id=how-good-is-the-20mm-ƒ18g>How Good is the 20mm ƒ/1.8G?</h2><h3 id=sharpness>Sharpness</h3><p>The lens is incredibly sharp. The 24MP DX sensor is the most demanding configuration for lenses across any system but there’s nothing that the 20mm ƒ/1.8G leaves on the table in terms of detail. The corners are not as sharp as the centre but that’s expected from a rectilinear wide-angle lens. Anyway, it easily out-resolves the wide zooms available for DX. While you can find MTF numbers etc. published by professional reviewers, I can tell you that at ƒ/8 in daylight, I need to <em>reduce</em> the default sharpness setting on my RAW converter for this lens. This is in the league of 85mm ƒ/1.8G performance, which itself is well known for its sharpness.<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/code_martial/25820023384/ title="Seiko Quartz Analog" target=_blank><figure><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/1590/25820023384_474875dec4_k.jpg alt="Seiko Quartz Analog" style=max-width:100%;aspect-ratio:><figcaption>Epic Sharpness</figcaption></figure></a></p><h3 id=rendering>Rendering</h3><p>This is my first lens with Nikon’s Nano Crystal coating and while I’ve not found any solid endorsements for the coating from pro photographers, I feel it gives a different “look” to the pictures. Its contrast and edge acuity feels a lot like that of the Zeiss T* equipped lenses, like in the Sony RX100. The biggest impact of this coating is felt with high ISO images where the extra edge definition and micro-contrast helps the noise-reduction algorithms retain the details better.<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/code_martial/25498269780/ title="JBL Flip" target=_blank><figure><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/1668/25498269780_f3a10dc9ad_k.jpg alt="JBL Flip" style=max-width:100%;aspect-ratio:><figcaption>High ISO details. ISO 3200, ƒ/1.8. Visible texture in the “JBL” logo.</figcaption></figure></a></p><h3 id=close-up-shooting>Close-Up Shooting</h3><p>The 20mm ƒ/1.8G focuses down to a minimum distance of 20 cm from the sensor, which roughly works out to 7 cm from the front of the lens. That is pretty close for most situations. This is <em>not</em> a macro/micro lens, though, since its wide FoV means that even at this close distance, its maximum magnification is only about a quarter of a true macro lens. Having said that, this is good enough for some funny people photography and taking pictures of food, gadgets, etc.<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/code_martial/26417389294/ title=Burj-al-Arab target=_blank><figure><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/7521/26417389294_a48269799b_b.jpg alt=Burj-al-Arab style=max-width:100%;aspect-ratio:><figcaption>This 2 inch tall tower looks great from the 20cm MFD, even with a 2.2x digital zoom.</figcaption></figure></a></p><h3 id=heading></h3><h2 id=shortcomings>Shortcomings</h2><p>While the 20mm ƒ/1.8G is a cracker of a lens, it does have a couple of issues, both to do with its applicability. The first is its size and weight. With an 82mm diameter and 355g weight, this is one big prime – twice as big as the 35mm ƒ/1.8G DX. I would have loved for it to be about the size of a 50mm ƒ/1.8D – that noisy little lens. I wish for a DX DSLR equivalent of the Fuji X100, but there’s a bulk tax that Nikon’s DX shooters must pay for the lack of proper DX primes.</p><p>The second issue is with AF accuracy on the D7100. While the lens focuses on the right thing with the D3300’s 11-point AF system, the 53-point AF module sometimes doesn’t focus on the intended target. 3D tracking AF is too unpredictable to use. AF-S works most of the time but close focusing against a distracting background needs some care. I think it’s got more to do with the combination of a large aperture and wide focal length rather than operational defects in the equipment.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The 20mm ƒ/1.8G Nikkor makes for a great general purpose lens on DX bodies, but its size and weight hamper the portability a bit. Nonetheless, its combination with the current Nikon 24MP DX sensors is great for low light social photography or taking pictures of food, etc.</p><p>The nice thing is, if you pair your DX body with an FX body, this very lens would give an ultra-wide FoV on FX. There is a narrow range of focal lengths (19-25mm, I reckon) where the DX crop factor changes the perspective significantly enough to allow the same lens to be used as two different lenses in an FX-DX pairing. The 20mm falls well within that range.</p><p><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/code_martial/26862293845/ title="Sky High" target=_blank><figure><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/7450/26862293845_719c743222_k.jpg alt="Sky High" style=max-width:100%;aspect-ratio:><figcaption>Just like a smartphone.
