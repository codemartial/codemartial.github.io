I mirrored my laptop on the projector and went through a fresh install of Go from source on my [newly allocated] dev box. Everyone else had identical dev environments so they could follow what I was doing on-screen. At the end of it everyone had a functional Go workspace!</p><p>Whatâ€™s even better, I showed them how super easy it is to create packages and use them in a program. From conducting the installation to demonstrating package creation, it only took 1 hour. This included 10 minutes fiddling with Vim settings for syntax highlighting â€” the most difficult part of the entire session ðŸ˜‰</p><p>Presenting slide decks is one thing. Itâ€™s a totally different experience when you do a live demo with no prior preparation except the confidence that what youâ€™re about to demo will work without much fuss.</p></article><hr><div style=display:flex;width:100%><div style=width:50%><p style=text-align:left>Previous Post:<br><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/05/why-program-in-go/>Why I Program in Go</a></p></div><div style=width:50%><p style=text-align:right>Next Post:<br><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/01/23/the-compiler-as-a-refactoring-aid/>The Compiler as a Refactoring Aid</a></p></div></div></main></div><div id=sidebar><nav class=sidebar-nav><ul><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/posts/ title=Articles>Articles</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/about/ title=About>About</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/photos/ title=Photos>Photos</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/photography/ title=photography>photography</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/programming/ title=programming>programming</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/reviews/ title=reviews>reviews</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/technology/ title=technology>technology</a></li></ul></div><div id=section2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/>Articles</a></p></div><div id=logo><a href=/><svg id="svgLogo" baseProfile="full" xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 400 100" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid"><radialGradient id="logoGradient"><stop offset="30%" stop-color="#00ff80"/><stop offset="67%" stop-color="#00c000"/><stop offset="100%" stop-color="#606000"/></radialGradient><polygon points="0, 67 160, 0 200, 100 240, 0 400, 67 240, 33 200, 67 160, 33" fill="url(#logoGradient)"/></svg></a></div><div id=space><p>Tahir Hashmi</p></div><footer id=footer>mail@tahirhashmi.com
