This bar is wrong in a lot of ways. The way it stands out in all its ugliness from the rest of the Flickr visual design speaks volumes about how it was executed (thoughtlessly, in a draconian way), how little the Flickr development team have a say in how things work (I can’t imagine a product owner who would allow such visual desecration of their product without a protest) and how little Yahoo!"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/07/04/the-lost-flickr-of-hope/"><meta property="article:section" content="posts"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2013-07-04T10:35:39+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2023-04-09T23:03:28+07:00"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="The Lost Flickr of Hope"><meta name=twitter:description content="I woke up this Tuesday morning to a shock.

The way it stands out in all its ugliness from the rest of the <a href=http://flickr.com target=_blank rel=noopener>Flickr</a> visual design speaks volumes about how it was executed (thoughtlessly, in a draconian way), how little the Flickr development team have a say in how things work (I can’t imagine a product owner who would allow such visual desecration of their product without a protest) and how little Yahoo! as a company cares about its vocal community (no attempt made by Flickr staff to respond to the <a href=http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157634438561292/ target=_blank rel=noopener>outpour of grief</a> in their help forum).</p><p>The newly redesigned Flickr reminded me that I’ve been on Flickr for a very, very long time – close to 9 years. My joining of Flickr pre-dates its acquisition by Yahoo!. I have been with Flickr through the several major design changes to its layout and functionality and through the waves of people from Flickr community leaving for other competitors. More importantly, I was generally quite vocal in my defence of Flickr and the changes it brought about. The only time I previously considered looking for alternatives was when the site had not received any significant updates in ages.</p><p>I think I was naïve. I think the people who left earlier had better foresight.</p><p>I revoked my Pro account yesterday. Barring a few days of discontinuity between manual renewals, this is the first time in 8 years or so that I’ve dropped to a free account on Flickr.</p><p>I don’t intend to continue with any more public photo uploads to Flickr. I haven’t decided which service to use next, partly because it’s a difficult choice. Flickr is a great website. Despite years of neglect in community building, it still has strong community participation. There are other <a href=http://smugmug.com target=_blank rel=noopener>photo</a> <a href=http://500px.com target=_blank rel=noopener>hosting</a> <a href=http://plus.google.com target=_blank rel=noopener>websites</a>, other <a href=http://pinterest.com target=_blank rel=noopener>photo</a> <a href=http://facebook.com target=_blank rel=noopener>sharing</a> <a href=http://plus.google.com target=_blank rel=noopener>websites</a> and other <a href=http://www.dpreview.com/forums target=_blank rel=noopener>online</a> <a href=http://photo.net/ target=_blank rel=noopener>communities</a>. But there’s none that brings all these aspects together the way Flickr does.</p><p>Looks like I will have to find not one but two alternatives – a showcase and a community to replace my daily Flickr fix with.</p><p><em>PS: Some people recommend deleting photos from Flickr or making them private to disallow Yahoo! from making advertising money from our pictures. However, I don’t think I’m going to do that. I don’t want to break the trust of scores of third party pages that have legitimately embedded my photos instead of just flicking them without credit.</em></p></article><div style=display:flex;width:100%><div style=width:50%><p style=text-align:left>Previous Post:<br><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/05/11/shooting-jpegs/>From Shooting RAWs to Shooting JPEGs</a></p></div><div style=width:50%><p style=text-align:right>Next Post:<br><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/2013/10/28/six-months-with-nikon-d7100/>Six Months with Nikon D7100</a></p></div></div></main></div><div id=sidebar><nav class=sidebar-nav><ul><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/posts/ title=Articles>Articles</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/about/ title=About>About</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/photos/ title=Photos>Photos</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/opinion/ title=opinion>opinion</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/photography/ title=photography>photography</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/programming/ title=programming>programming</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/reviews/ title=reviews>reviews</a></li><li><a class=sidebar-nav-item href=/categories/technology/ title=technology>technology</a></li></ul><aside class=toc><h4>On this page</h4><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></aside><div id=fastSearch><span id=cursor><input id=searchInput tabindex=0 placeholder=search></span><ul id=searchResults></ul></div></nav></div><div id=section2><p><a href=https://tahirhashmi.com/posts/>Articles</a></p></div><div id=logo><a href=/><svg id="svgLogo" baseProfile="full" xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 400 100" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid"><radialGradient id="logoGradient"><stop offset="30%" stop-color="#00ff80"/><stop offset="67%" stop-color="#00c000"/><stop offset="100%" stop-color="#606000"/></radialGradient><polygon points="0, 67 160, 0 200, 100 240, 0 400, 67 240, 33 200, 67 160, 33" fill="url(#logoGradient)"/></svg></a></div><div id=space><p>Tahir Hashmi</p></div><footer id=footer>mail@tahirhashmi.com
